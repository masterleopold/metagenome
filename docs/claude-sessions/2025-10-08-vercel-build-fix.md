### Session: Vercel Build Fix - TypeScript Typed Routes (2025-10-08)

**Objective**: Fix Vercel deployment build errors related to TypeScript typed routes

**Issue Summary:**
Vercel build failed with TypeScript errors when using Next.js 15.5.4's `typedRoutes` feature. The errors occurred because route href values were typed as generic strings instead of const-asserted literal types required by the typed routes system.

**Root Cause:**
1. Next.js with `typedRoutes: true` requires href values to be literal string types, not generic strings
2. Navigation arrays lacked `as const` assertions, causing TypeScript to infer `string` type
3. Alert component had incorrect variant "error" instead of "destructive"

**Key Changes:**

1. **TypeScript Type Fixes**:
   - Added `as const` assertions to all navigation hrefs in:
     * `docs-portal/src/app/page.tsx` (quickLinks array)
     * `docs-portal/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` (navigation array)
     * `docs-portal/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` (navigation items)
   - This ensures TypeScript infers exact literal types like `"/getting-started"` instead of generic `string`

2. **Component Variant Fixes**:
   - Changed Alert variant from "error" to "destructive" in:
     * `docs-portal/src/app/pipeline-phases/page.tsx` (PERV Critical Detection alert)
     * `docs-portal/src/app/pmda-compliance/page.tsx` (Critical Pathogens and PERV alerts)
   - Alert component supports: "default" | "destructive" | "warning" | "success"
   - Badge component supports: "default" | "secondary" | "success" | "warning" | "error" | "outline"

**Files Modified:**
- `docs-portal/src/app/page.tsx` - Added `as const` to quickLinks hrefs
- `docs-portal/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Added `as const` to navigation hrefs
- `docs-portal/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Added `as const` to all navigation item hrefs
- `docs-portal/src/app/pipeline-phases/page.tsx` - Fixed Alert variant to "destructive"
- `docs-portal/src/app/pmda-compliance/page.tsx` - Fixed Alert variants to "destructive"

**Technical Details:**

TypeScript const assertions (`as const`) make the following transformation:
```typescript
// Before (inferred as string):
const links = [{ href: "/getting-started" }]
// Type: { href: string }[]

// After (inferred as exact literal):
const links = [{ href: "/getting-started" as const }] as const
// Type: readonly [{ readonly href: "/getting-started" }]
```

This is required for Next.js typed routes which use template literal types to ensure only valid routes are used in Link components.

**Build Verification:**
- Local build: `npm run build` - ✅ Successful
- All TypeScript type errors resolved
- Production build output: 9 pages, ~102-115 kB per page
- All pages prerendered as static content

**Commit Information:**
- Commit Hash: 1b3883f
- Commit Message: fix(docs-portal): add 'as const' to navigation hrefs for TypeScript typed routes
- Branch: main
- Pushed to: https://github.com/masterleopold/metagenome
- Date: 2025-10-08

**Post-Fix Status:**
- ✅ Vercel build errors resolved
- ✅ All TypeScript errors fixed
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Next.js `typedRoutes` requires const-asserted literal types for all route hrefs
2. Always use `as const` for navigation arrays when typed routes are enabled
3. Component variant props must match exactly - "error" ≠ "destructive"
4. Local build testing catches Vercel deployment issues early
