# NGS vs Traditional Methods Cost Analysis Session
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Cost-benefit analysis of NGS metagenome approach vs traditional pathogen testing methods

## Session Overview

Created comprehensive cost-benefit analysis comparing three pathogen screening strategies for PMDA 91-pathogen compliance in xenotransplantation donor pig screening.

## Context

User received supervisor feedback proposing a hybrid strategy: use NGS metagenome analysis only for "problematic viruses" (PCR false positives, incomplete assay systems, high variability) and traditional methods (PCR, culture, serology, microscopy) for remaining pathogens. The session focused on quantitative analysis to support decision-making.

## Work Completed

### 1. Created Cost Analysis Document

**File**: `md/NGS全量解析vs従来法ハイブリッド戦略_コスト・手間分析.md`

Comprehensive 6-section analysis (excluding recommendations per user request):

#### Section 1: Hybrid Strategy Design
- Defined 3 patterns for comparison:
  - **Pattern A**: NGS for all 91 pathogens
  - **Pattern B**: Hybrid (NGS for 15-20 problematic pathogens + traditional methods for 71-76 pathogens)
  - **Pattern C**: Traditional methods only for all 91 pathogens

#### Section 2: Detailed Cost Comparison

**Pattern A - NGS All 91 Pathogens** (¥162,574/sample):
- Wet lab: ¥92,074 (cfDNA/cfRNA extraction, host depletion, DNA/RNA library prep)
- Sequencing: ¥12,500 (MinION flow cell 1/12 share)
- Bioinformatics: ¥10,000 (AWS pipeline)
- Labor: ¥48,000 (24h total work)

**Pattern B - Hybrid Strategy** (¥449,574/sample):
- NGS portion: ¥162,574 (same as Pattern A)
- PCR (24 viruses): ¥37,000
- Culture (27 bacteria): ¥125,000
- Serology (15 pathogens): ¥85,000
- Microscopy (19 parasites): ¥40,000
- **Total**: ¥449,574 (2.8× Pattern A cost)

**Pattern C - Traditional Only** (¥315,000/sample):
- Extended traditional methods for all 91 pathogens
- Regulatory non-compliant (no unknown pathogen detection)

**Annual Cost Comparison** (24 samples/year):
- Pattern A: ¥3,901,776
- Pattern B: ¥10,789,776 (+176% vs A)
- Pattern C: ¥7,560,000 (+94% vs A)

#### Section 3: Effort/Time Comparison

**Pattern A - NGS All**:
- Hands-on time: 20h/sample
- Turnaround: 3-5 days
- Breakdown: Wet lab 16h + data analysis 4h

**Pattern B - Hybrid**:
- Hands-on time: 72h/sample (+260% vs A)
- Turnaround: 7-10 days (culture bottleneck)
- Breakdown: NGS 20h + PCR 6h + Culture 26h + Serology 10h + Microscopy 10h

**Pattern C - Traditional**:
- Hands-on time: 56h/sample (+180% vs A)
- Turnaround: 7-10 days

#### Section 4: Technical Challenges & Risks

**Sample Volume Issues**:
- NGS requires: 5-10mL plasma
- Hybrid requires: 10-19mL total (NGS + traditional methods)
- Risk: Sample depletion, need for increased blood draw (animal welfare concern)

**Detection Sensitivity Inconsistency**:
- NGS LOD: 10-50 copies/mL (uniform)
- PCR LOD: 1-10 copies/mL
- Culture LOD: 10-100 CFU/mL
- Microscopy LOD: 100-1,000 cells/mL
- Risk: Non-uniform sensitivity across pathogens makes regulatory justification difficult

**Data Integration Complexity**:
- 5 different data formats (FASTQ, Ct values, CFU counts, antibody titers, microscopy observations)
- Manual integration required → human error risk
- ALCOA+ data integrity compliance challenges (paper records from culture/microscopy)

**Technical Staff Requirements**:
- Pattern A: 1-2 NGS specialists
- Pattern B: Specialists in 5 disciplines (molecular biology, microbiology, immunology, parasitology, bioinformatics)
- Risk: Recruitment difficulty, training costs, succession planning

#### Section 5: PMDA Regulatory Compliance

**MHLW Xenotransplantation Guideline Requirement**:
> "Donor animal pathogen testing must include methods capable of detecting **unknown pathogens**"

**Compliance Assessment**:
- **Pattern A**: ✓ Full compliance (metagenome detects unknown pathogens)
- **Pattern B**: △ Partial compliance (only 15-20 pathogens covered by metagenome, 71-76 by traditional = no unknown variant detection for majority)
- **Pattern C**: ✗ Non-compliant (traditional methods detect only known pathogens)

**Validation Requirements**:
- Pattern A: Single method validation, 6-12 months, ¥5,000,000
- Pattern B: 5 methods validation, 12-24 months, ¥15,000,000 (3× cost, 2× time)
- Pattern C: 5 methods validation, 12-24 months, ¥12,000,000

**ALCOA+ Data Integrity**:
- Pattern A: ✓ Full digital traceability (FAST5, FASTQ, BAM, VCF)
- Pattern B: △ Mixed (digital NGS + paper culture logs/microscopy observations)
- Pattern C: △ Mixed paper/digital records

## Lessons Learned

### Cost Analysis Methodology
- Must include both direct costs (reagents, equipment) and indirect costs (labor, validation, training)
- PMDA regulatory compliance costs (validation, data integrity) are significant differentiators
- Sample volume constraints in hybrid strategies are often overlooked but critical

### Japanese Technical Documentation
- Comprehensive tabular formats work well for cost comparisons
- Mermaid diagrams effectively communicate workflow differences
- Quantitative comparisons (¥, hours, days) more persuasive than qualitative arguments

### Regulatory Strategy
- PMDA "unknown pathogen detection" requirement is a binary compliance gate
- Data integrity (ALCOA+) requirements favor digital-native approaches
- Validation complexity grows exponentially with multiple methods

## Next Steps

1. User to present cost analysis to supervisor
2. Potential follow-up: ROI sensitivity analysis (sample volume scenarios)
3. Consider: Modified hybrid recommendation (NGS backbone + PCR confirmation for 5-10 critical pathogens)
